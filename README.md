# django-ecommerce-learning
A learning-focused Django e-commerce project built step-by-step to understand real-world web application concepts.  The project starts with a session-based shopping cart and gradually evolves into a full database-backed cart, order management system, and email confirmations.  The main goal is deep understanding, not just functionality.
