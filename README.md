# Django E-Commerce Learning Project

This project is a step-by-step learning journey into building a real-world e-commerce system using Django.

## Current Features (Up to Day 12)

- User authentication (signup, login, logout)
- Session-based shopping cart
- Add, remove, increase, and decrease cart items
- Cart total calculation
- Checkout flow
- Flash messages for login/logout
- Protected checkout using login_required

## Learning Focus

This project is not just about building an online store.
It focuses on understanding:
- Why sessions are used
- When sessions break down
- How carts evolve into database-backed systems
- Django request/response lifecycle
- Authentication logic
- Clean separation of concerns

## Next Steps

- Move cart data from sessions into the database
- Persist carts per user
- Track orders and order items
- Send email confirmations after checkout
- Improve user experience and scalability

## Notes

Each major change is committed separately to preserve learning history.
